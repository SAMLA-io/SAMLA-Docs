# Pinecone Integration

## Overview
Pinecone serves as our primary vector database for the [[SAMLA Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]] system. We utilize both dense and sparse vector representations to optimize search capabilities and retrieval accuracy.

## Architecture

### Dual Index Strategy
We maintain two separate Pinecone indexes:
1. **Dense Index**: Uses dense vector embeddings for semantic similarity search
2. **Sparse Index**: Uses sparse vector representations for keyword-based search

Both indexes contain the same document data but are transformed differently to serve distinct search purposes.

### Multi-tenant Isolation
- Each organization's data is isolated using Pinecone namespaces
- The namespace identifier corresponds to the [[organization_id]]
- This ensures complete data separation between different enterprise customers

## Index Configuration

### Dense Index
- Uses the `multilingual-e5-large` model for generating embeddings
- Optimized for semantic similarity search
- Captures contextual relationships between documents

### Sparse Index
- Optimized for keyword-based search
- Provides complementary search capabilities to the dense index
- Helps improve retrieval accuracy for specific terms and phrases

## Data Management

### Document Storage
- Documents are processed and stored in both dense and sparse formats
- Each document entry includes:
  - Vector embeddings (dense or sparse)
  - Metadata (document ID, organization ID, etc.)
  - Original text content

### Namespace Management
- Each organization's data is stored in a dedicated namespace
- Namespace ID format: `org_{organization_id}`
- Ensures data isolation and security between organizations

## API Integration

The system provides several endpoints for managing Pinecone indexes:
- `create-dense-index`: Initialize or update the dense vector index
- `create-sparse-index`: Initialize or update the sparse vector index
- `list-indexes`: View available indexes and their configurations
- `search`: Perform hybrid search across both dense and sparse indexes

## Best Practices

1. **Index Maintenance**
   - Regular monitoring of index performance
   - Periodic cleanup of outdated or irrelevant documents
   - Index optimization for search performance

2. **Data Security**
   - Strict namespace isolation
   - Access control based on organization ID
   - Regular security audits

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient batch processing for document updates
   - Optimized vector dimensions for both dense and sparse indexes
   - Regular performance monitoring and tuning

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Storage Constraints**
   - Monitor namespace size limits
   - Implement cleanup strategies for large datasets
   - Consider data retention policies

2. **Search Performance**
   - Balance between dense and sparse search results
   - Consider query complexity and response time
   - Monitor search accuracy metrics

3. **Cost Management**
   - Monitor API usage and costs
   - Implement rate limiting where necessary
   - Optimize index operations for cost efficiency

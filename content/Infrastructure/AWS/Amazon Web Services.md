# Amazon Web Services

This document outlines the AWS services used in the SAMLA system and their specific roles in supporting the infrastructure.

## Services Used

### [[AWS Lambda]]
- Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events
- Used for:
  - Processing document uploads
  - Handling search queries
  - Managing index operations
  - Executing background tasks
- Benefits:
  - Automatic scaling
  - Pay-per-use pricing
  - No server management required
  - Built-in high availability

### [[Elastic Container Registry (ECR)]]
- Fully managed Docker container registry
- Used for:
  - Storing container images
  - Versioning container deployments
  - Managing image lifecycle
  - Securing container artifacts
- Features:
  - Private container repositories
  - Image scanning for vulnerabilities
  - Integration with ECS
  - Cross-region replication

### [[Elastic Container Service (ECS)]]
- Highly scalable container orchestration service, used for publishing our [[Agents]] in the cloud
- Used for:
  - Running containerized applications
  - Managing service deployments
  - Scaling container workloads
  - Load balancing container traffic
- Capabilities:
  - Serverless Fargate option
  - Task definitions
  - Service discovery
  - Auto-scaling

### [[Amazon API Gateway]]
- Fully managed service for creating, publishing, and maintaining APIs
- Used for:
  - Exposing RAG system endpoints
  - Managing API versions
  - Implementing rate limiting
  - Handling authentication
- Benefits:
  - REST and WebSocket support
  - Automatic scaling
  - Caching capabilities
  - Request/response transformation

## Infrastructure Architecture

The SAMLA system leverages these AWS services in a modern containerized architecture:
1. API Gateway receives incoming requests
2. Lambda functions handle serverless workloads
3. ECR stores container images
4. ECS orchestrates container deployments
5. Services communicate through API Gateway endpoints

## Best Practices

- Use AWS Lambda layers for shared code
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Set up appropriate monitoring and logging
- Follow container security best practices
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Use AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure as code
